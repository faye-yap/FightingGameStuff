Knight:
some minor differences in frame data, but nothing major
should be fully functional

Pawn:
added flashing colours on grab success for 3b, lasso awkwardly fades into oblivion on miss, no main body animation though
no main body animation for neutral special whiff either
2s stays out longer but has longer recovery time, animation looked weird otherwise
6s does not teleport yet, to be fixed in code
grab is definitely implemented in an odd fashion
apparently crouch is weird, might be a state machine issue if the knight one works fine


check:
are the prefabs coming out of the right place? can be fixed by: 
- exporting the sprites with better consistency
- adding offset to the prefab on a case-by-case basis
- changing the relative position at runtime via code
