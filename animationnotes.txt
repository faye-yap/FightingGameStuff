Knight:
some minor differences in frame data, but nothing major
should be fully functional, including super, but no crouchblock?

Pawn:
added flashing colours on grab success for 3b, lasso awkwardly fades into oblivion on miss, no main body animation though
no main body animation for neutral special whiff either
2s stays out longer but has longer recovery time, animation looked weird otherwise
6s does not teleport yet, to be fixed in code
grab is definitely implemented in an odd fashion
apparently crouch is weird, might be a state machine issue if the knight one works fine

Bishop:
crouching S frame data is way off due to the animation requirements (needs testing to see if all the parts work properly)
neutral A: can't possibly come out as fast as suggested
book invulnerability is a bit inconsistent

check:
are the prefabs coming out of the right place? can be fixed by: 
- exporting the sprites with better consistency
- adding offset to the prefab on a case-by-case basis
- changing the relative position at runtime via code

stretch improvements to try:
- modify block / crouchblock hurtboxes for all

important note:
to edit frame data, make sure to edit both the move prefab AND the move animation in the main body, or the recovery times may not be what you expect
