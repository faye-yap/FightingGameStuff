Knight:
some minor differences in frame data, but nothing major
should be fully functional, including super, but no crouchblock?

Pawn:
added flashing colours on grab success for 3b, lasso awkwardly fades into oblivion on miss, no main body animation though
no main body animation for neutral special whiff either
2s stays out longer but has longer recovery time, animation looked weird otherwise
6s does not teleport yet, to be fixed in code
grab is definitely implemented in an odd fashion
apparently crouch is weird, might be a state machine issue if the knight one works fine
check prefab spawn locations on a case-by-case basis, probably really finnicky with pawn

Bishop:
crouching S frame data is way off due to the animation requirements (needs testing to see if all the parts work properly with the current offsets)
neutral A: can't possibly come out as fast as suggested
book invulnerability is a bit inconsistent
99% sure the bishop super should have its prefab x-axis offset = 12
bishop grab whiff / success has no book sprite in the animations, not sure where to put it, also no "main body" animation (if any is required)
neutral s: the eye has a hitbox, if it's too op you can remove it
need to line up the book with the move, can just change x/y offsets of the move

rook: 
crouching a, jumping a, neutral a, throw needs a main body animation
rest of the moves can hide body for the duration of the move, since move is handled completely in the prefab
super and jB movement need to be handled in code

check:
are the prefabs coming out of the right place? can be fixed by: 
- exporting the sprites with better consistency
- adding offset to the prefab on a case-by-case basis
- changing the relative position at runtime via code

stretch improvements to try:
- modify block / crouchblock hurtboxes for all

important note:
to edit frame data, make sure to edit both the move prefab AND the move animation in the main body, or the recovery times may not be what you expect
